Accidental token or credential leakage presents a significant concern within digital environments. 
Current secret detection methods employ ruleset-based techniques to identify secret information. 
These methods use pattern recognition within strings (i.e. regex rules) to pinpoint characteristics that resemble various types of secrets. 
My research addresses the possibility of using heuristics to develop a reliable and accurate method for determining if a given string is merely a piece of inconsequential data or a leaked secret requiring timely attention.
