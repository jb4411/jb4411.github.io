Update for the week of 3/24 - 3/28.

### Gratitudes:
- Updated and balanced dataset
- Met with thesis committee and set up next meeting
- Implemented Huffman coding
- Retrained ML model and solution vector


### Challenges:
- Reworking code to use Huffman coding instead of Zlib
- Retraining both the ML model and solution vector using the new dataset


### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Continue writing my thesis
- Get thesis draft to a point where it can be shared with my committee
- Meet with my academic advisor
