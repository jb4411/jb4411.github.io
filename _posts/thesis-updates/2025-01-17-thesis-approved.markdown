Update for the week of 1/13 - 1/17.

Thesis proposal approved!

### Gratitudes:
- getting registered for thesis
- getting a GitHub repository set up
- having a committee that is small, and composed of people who are both truly smart and sincerely kind

### Challenges:
- The last-minute scramble to get my thesis proposal completed, get all the decisions and approvals in place to get the proposal in, and get officially registered for my thesis.

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- getting my thesis website set up
- get a committee Zoom meeting scheduled
- set up a Google doc to collect pieces of preliminary thesis text
- start work on tokenizer
