Update for the week of 3/3 - 3/7.

### Gratitudes:
- Investigated techniques discovered while searching for Shannon Entropy secret detection references
- Started on graphs and visualizations for thesis


### Challenges:
- Had less time to work as I am preparing to go on a trip next week (to visit my grandfather on his 100th birthday)

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Add Regex support to codebase to enable comparisons to my techniques
- Meet with a committee member to determine if I should change my focus to writing up my thesis now that the codebase is in good shape
