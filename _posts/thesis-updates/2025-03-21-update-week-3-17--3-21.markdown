Update for the week of 3/17 - 3/21.

### Gratitudes:
- Streamlined the code used for testing and better integrated Regex
- Compiled all thesis related notes and writing
- Worked on thesis


### Challenges:
- My thesis notes and writing are rather spread out, so pulling information together from these sources is tedious at times
- Busy week - less time to work on thesis than I would have liked


### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Continue writing my thesis
- Continue working on graphs and visualizations for thesis
- Set up meeting with thesis committee
