Update for the week of 2/3 - 2/7.

### Gratitudes:
- Found some good references for Shannon Entropy based secret detection which have also given me some new techniques to look into
- Created an Overleaf file for my thesis

### Challenges:
- None of the Shannon Entropy references are as easily citable as traditionally published papers, which is annoying
- Reworking and updating code to accommodate a new solution vector has been more time consuming than I had hoped
- Finding time to work on my thesis was difficult this week

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Developing a new solution vector (continued)
- Investigating techniques discovered while searching for Shannon Entropy secret detection references
