Update for the week of 1/20 - 1/24.

### Gratitudes:
- Basic tokenizer for python code working 
- Highlighted PDF creation based on python code 
- Started work on integrating the secret detection code used in preliminary research.

### Challenges:
- Getting highlighting and formatting to work for the generated PDFs has been annoying and a pain. The output is equivalent to the original file, but not identical due to the way the tokenizer handles whitespace that is not syntactically required, but instead added for stylistic purposes.

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Finish integrating existing secret detection 
- Find code to test on 
- Look into tokenizing some types of simple config files
