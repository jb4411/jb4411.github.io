Update for the week of 2/17 - 2/21.

### Gratitudes:
- Completely rewrote the dataset loading system. This rewrite should make testing new datasets far easier.
- Started testing a dataset created from a Python codebase


### Challenges:
- The previous dataset system was highly fractured and had many non-general parts, which lead to the rewrite being tedious and finicky
- Many of the ideas I plan to test are requiring significant rewrites, upgrades, and/or additions to the existing foundation to be tested. However, once all this foundational code is complete, testing should proceed much faster


### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Creating and testing new datasets
- Developing a new solution vector (continued)
- Investigating techniques discovered while searching for Shannon Entropy secret detection references (continued)
