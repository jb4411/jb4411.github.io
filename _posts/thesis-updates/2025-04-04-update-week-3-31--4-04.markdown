Update for the week of 3/31 - 4/4.

### Gratitudes:
- Met with academic advisor
- Implemented a new metric - character type mix / character type chunking. This metric helped improve accuracy, especially for shorter strings.
- Trained new ML model and solution vector using the new metric.
- Continued writing thesis

### Challenges:
- Reworking code to use the new metric
- Retraining both the ML model and solution vector using the new metric
- Creating some of the graphs / visualizations needed for thesis

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Continue writing my thesis
- Get thesis draft to a point where it can be shared with my committee
- Meet with full thesis committee
