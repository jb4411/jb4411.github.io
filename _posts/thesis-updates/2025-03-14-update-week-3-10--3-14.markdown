Update for the week of 3/10 - 3/14.

### Gratitudes:
- Added a regex mode to use when comparing to my techniques
- Was able to meet with one of my committee members in person and we determined that the code is in a good place, and I can switch my focus to writing up my thesis


### Challenges:
- Had less time to work on my thesis due to traveling this week (but got to see my grandfather blow out the candles on his 100th birthday cake)

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Start the writing for my thesis
- Work on graphs and visualizations for thesis
