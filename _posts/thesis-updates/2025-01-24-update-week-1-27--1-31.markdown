Update for the week of 1/27 - 1/31.

### Gratitudes:
- Really appreciated the Zoom meeting with my thesis committee
- Integrated existing secret detection with Python tokenization
- Improved visualizations for testing various techniques

### Challenges:
- Getting the secret detector to work well with code is looking like it will require some non-trivial changes to the solution vector, as well as new techniques
- Changing the solution vector means new solution vectors will need to be found
- Changing the solution vector also means that other portions of the code will need to be updated to reflect this

### Next week’s priorities:
- "Related work" section in thesis (shannon entropy for secret detection)
- Overleaf file - may need to make Ivona the owner…
- Developing a new solution vector
