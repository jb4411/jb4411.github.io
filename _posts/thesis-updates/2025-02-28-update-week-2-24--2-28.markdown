Update for the week of 2/24 - 2/28.

### Gratitudes:
- I was finally able to once again test new and different solution vectors now that more foundational code is in place.
- I implemented and tested models using a neural network (as opposed to a solution vector)
- Tested a new innocuous dataset that was created from existing Python codebases using my newly streamlined data preprocessing

### Challenges:
- One of the new neural network models is fairly unstable, and will likely require different training code to make training stable
- Finding sufficient amounts of code to use for the innocuous dataset is proving difficult

### Next weekâ€™s priorities:
- Finding additional code for the innocuous dataset
- Rewriting training code and NN model for better stability
- Investigating techniques discovered while searching for Shannon Entropy secret detection references (continued)
